#Vertical Page Layer (Stack) Editor

This repo holds a proof-of-concept I am building as I learn Backbone.js. for a visual page editor that allows definition of vertically-layered full-width content containers _(Page Layers)_

This is a **temporary repository** that I intend to later delete so please do wrote code that depends on it to exist.

You can see the current demo [here](http://newclarity.net/stack-editor/).

This is a work-in-progress; don't expect the code to be complete or even well-written, and don't expect the demo to make sense unless you've spoken to me first.
