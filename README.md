#Vertical Page Layer (Stack) Editor

This repo holds a proof-of-concept I am building as I learn Backbone.js. for a visual page editor that allows definition of vertically-layered full-width content containers _(Page Layers)_.  

##Use Case
The idea is that this stack editor will be embedded into a custom post type edit page in WordPress for company's [Brands](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/define-brand.html) pages on their WordPress-based **intranet** _(yes: "intranet," you read that correct.)_ As currently this code is completely self-contained and is just standalone HTML+CSS+JS where the JS is jQuery, jQuery UI, Underscore, Backbone and custom JS.


##Status
This is a work-in-progress; don't expect the code to be complete or even well-written, and don't expect the demo to make sense unless you've spoken to me first.

And this is a **temporary repository** that I intend to later delete so please do wrote code that depends on it to exist.


##Demo
You can see the current demo [here](http://newclarity.net/stack-editor/).
